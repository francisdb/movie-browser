#How to use the application

= Introduction =

Well I mostly made it for my own use and I'm not sure the current version is usable without problems.

The program only works if your _movies are in subdirectories_ like this:

movies (dir)
   * forest gump  (subdir)
   * pulp fiction (subdir)

after choosing movie - import folder in the menu the folder will be scanned and all info will be fetched from imdb / rotten tomatoes.
