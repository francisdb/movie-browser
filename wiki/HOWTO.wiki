= Introduction =

The program only works if your _movies are in subdirectories_ or just _files in the root folders_ like this:

movies (dir)
   * forest gump  (subdir)
   * pulp fiction (subdir)

movies2 (dir)
   * dumbo (subdir)
   * free.willy.avi
   * dumb.and.dumber.avi

after choosing movie - import folder in the menu the folder will be scanned and all info will be fetched from imdb / rotten tomatoes / ...


= Let us know / help out =

If this does not work for you (other dir structure / other problems), create an issue! We will probably update the program so it fits your needs. Other java programmers are free to join the project, let us know if you are interested:
